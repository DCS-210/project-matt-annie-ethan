Examining Driving Factors in Exoplanet Exploration
================
by Annie, Matt, and Ethan

## Summary

Data: We used two different datasets for this project. The first
dataset was filtered from the NASA Exoplanet Archives Planet Systems
Dataset that consists of a compilation of system, stellar, and planetary
parameters for known confirmed exoplanets. There are 8 categories of
over 100 different variables and we chose 23 variables that were
relevant to answering our research question. Then, we created two data
frames for our project where one includes unfiltered data with missing
values under many variables except the discovery year, and the other one
includes filtered data for all 23 variables. The second dataset came
from the World Bank GDP Per-Capita Dataset which includes the annual
measure of GDP per-capita for every country in the world and some larger
regions from 1960-2020. For our project, we focused on the most up to
date data from 2020.

Research questions: Our initial research question was broken down into
two parts. First, we sought out to determine the main driving factors in exoplanet
discovery, and how exactly these factors could influence the future of exoplanet
exploration? Second, we asked whether observable trends in exoplanet discovery suggest that over time discovery will diverge (and thus an infinite number of exoplanets will be discovered) or converge to a finite numberm(thus discovery will get more difficult over time)? In the case that an expected convergence was found, we were then aiming to develop a statistical forecast to estimate the number of expected exoplanet discoveries over time? 

After doing thorough research and statistical analysis of our data, we found the second question to be essentially impossible for us to definitively answer due to the nature of technological innovation in the space industry and its unpredictability of how many new exoplanet discoveries would be found with each new technological advancement. In other words, we found that unless we could somehow predict the future of technological innovation, we would not be able to accurately determine how many exoplanets we'll be able to discover in future years. Even if we were able to determine the expected rate/pace of technological progress, we determined that every marginal technological advancement yields a wildly varying amount of increased exoplanet discovery capacity.

For this reason, we focused our resources on the first part of the research
question. We narrowed our sub research questions to explore how the number
of discovered exoplanets has changed over time (in relation to factors such as the type of
discovery method, discovery facility and distance from earth)? We also explored whether the number of discoveries varies across countries and how this result relates to the country’s gdp per capita (wealth)?

Methodology: We began our research by breaking down our research
question into smaller sub research questions that we thought we would
need to answer before answering the bigger question. Doing so outlined
our project so that we wouldn’t have to worry about going in the wrong
direction or off track as we only needed to focus on answering the small
roadmap questions. Answering the sub questions was similar to the
process that we would do in labs; we would fix up the data that we would
need first (filtering, mutating, etc.) and then plot them. Before we
actually plotted though, our group would come together and try to
visualize on pen and paper what we thought would convey their data the
best. Since we already knew which variables we were going to use, we
generally came to a consensus on what type of plot to use. This whole
project really came down to taking the big picture and breaking it down
into smaller and smaller chunks that we could easily work on. When we
would put together these puzzle pieces, we would get together and figure
out the best way to put them together until we put together the whole
picture. When we plotted maps or animations or leaflets or linear
regressions, it was putting together these puzzle pieces and sometimes
we went a bit fancy yet we made sure to keep it practical and easy to
digest for the class.

We recognized that the topic we were dealing with was one that very few members of our audience would likely have much background knowledge in, so we also made sure to familiarize ourselves, and our audience, with the background, history, and relevant terminology associated with exoplanet exploration. From there we were then able to dive into our analysis in a way that made more sense.

Findings: Results from our statistical analysis suggest that
advancements and innovation in the technology used to discover
exoplanets appears to be the main driving force behind the number of
exoplanets discovered each year as well as the ability to discover
planets of different sizes. Additionally, the average distance of exoplanet
discovery has been shown to increase over time due to advances in
technology (more powerful technology allows us to see further into space). The radii of exoplanets being discovered today has a larger range than it did in the early days of exoplanet exploration. Today, we are able to discover planets with smaller radii than 20 years ago. The
mass of exoplanets being discovered, however, remained constant
throughout the years. Lastly, we found that GDP per-capita of countries
with established space programs does not appear to have a significant
impact on the amount of exoplanets discovered by different countries.
Although the countries with established space programs all belong to the
category of developed/developing countries.

“This table displays all solutions for planet and host stars, regardless
of their relationship. This includes atypical systems such as
free-floating planets and those with multiple stars. This table also
contains Kepler, K2, and TESS candidate solutions for confirmed planet
systems, a nearly complete identification of published stellar
companions, and projected and true planet obliquities. This table
replaced the Confirmed Planets and Extended Planet Data tables, which
was retired in April 2021. Some user interface elements in this table
are different from other Exoplanet Archive interactive tables.”
