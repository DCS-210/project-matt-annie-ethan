## Summary
Dataset: We used two different datasets for this project. The first dataset was filtered from the NASA Exoplanet Archives Planet Systems Dataset that consists of a compilation of system, stellar, and planetary parameters for known confirmed exoplanets. There are 8 categories of over 100 different variables and we chose 23 variables that were relevant to answering our research question. Then, we created two data frames for our project where one includes unfiltered data with missing values under many variables except the discovery year, and the other one includes filtered data for all 23 variables. The second dataset came from the World Bank GDP Per-Capita Dataset which includes the annual measure of GDP per-capita for every country in the world and some larger regions from 1960-2020. For our project, we focused on the most up to date data from 2020. 

Research questions: Our initial research question was broken down into two parts. First, What are the main driving factors in exoplanet discovery, and how can these factors influence the future of exoplanet exploration? And second, do trends suggest that we diverge and discover an infinite number of exoplanets or do they converge to a finite number? If they converge, what is that number? After doing some research and statistical analysis of our data, we found out that the second question is rather improbable due to the nature of technological discoveries and its unpredictability of how many new exoplanet discoveries would be found with each technological advancement. Basically, even if we did find the rate of technological breakthrough, each technological discovery yields a wildly varying amount of exoplanet discoveries. Rather, we focused our resources on the first part of the research question. We narrowed our sub research questions to how has the number of discovered exoplanets changed over time (in relation to the type of discovery method, discovery facility and distance from earth)? How does the number of discoveries vary across countries and how does the result relate to the country’s gdp?

Methodology: We began our research by breaking down our research question into smaller sub research questions that we thought we would need to answer before answering the bigger question. Doing so outlined our project so that we wouldn’t have to worry about going in the wrong direction or off track as we only needed to focus on answering the small roadmap questions. Answering the sub questions was similar to the process that we would do in labs; we would fix up the data that we would need first (filtering, mutating, etc.) and then plot them. Before we actually plotted though, our group would come together and try to visualize on pen and paper what we thought would convey their data the best. Since we already knew which variables we were going to use, we generally came to a consensus on what type of plot to use. This whole project really came down to taking the big picture and breaking it down into smaller and smaller chunks that we could easily work on. When we would put together these puzzle pieces, we would get together and figure out the best way to put them together until we put together the whole picture. When we plotted maps or animations or leaflets or linear regressions, it was putting together these puzzle pieces and sometimes we went a bit fancy yet we made sure to keep it practical and easy to digest for the class.

Findings: Results from our statistical analysis suggest that advancements and innovation in the technology used to discover exoplanets appears to be the main driving force behind the number of exoplanets discovered each year as well as the ability to discover planets of different sizes. Additionally, the distance of exoplanets discovery has been shown to increase over time due to advances in technology. The radii of exoplanets being discovered today has a larger range than it did in the early days of exoplanet exploration. Today, we are able to discover planets with smaller radii than 20 years ago. The mass of exoplanets being discovered, however, remained constant throughout the years. Lastly, we found that GDP per-capita of countries with established space programs does not appear to have a significant impact on the amount of exoplanets discovered by different countries. Although the countries with established space programs all belong to the category of developed/developing countries.

"This table displays all solutions for planet and host stars, regardless of their relationship. This includes atypical systems such as free-floating planets and those with multiple stars. This table also contains Kepler, K2, and TESS candidate solutions for confirmed planet systems, a nearly complete identification of published stellar companions, and projected and true planet obliquities.
This table replaced the Confirmed Planets and Extended Planet Data tables, which was retired in April 2021. Some user interface elements in this table are different from other Exoplanet Archive interactive tables."
